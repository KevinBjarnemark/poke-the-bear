# Poke the bear!

## Introduction
This is a simple JavaScript game inspired by the famous expression **'Poke the bear!'**. The game is an attempt to solve the 'real-world problem' of drawing a random person out of a group, but in a more fun and creative way. To exemplify this, imagine a family whose children want to sit in the front seat of the car. One could easily bring up **'Poke the bear!'** on their phone or computer to randomly choose one lucky winner. The one who survives the bear encounter gets to sit in the front seat of the car. 

Since the winner is chosen randomly, a larger range of people can take part in the draw without the sensation of unfairness. 

### Rules
1. Players are drawn randomly and should take turns in poking the bear. 
2. As the players keep poking the bear while the rage meter increases, someone will eventually be kicked out of the game. 
3. The 'last standing' player that survived the bear encounter takes the price.
