# Poke the bear!

## Introduction
This is a simple JavaScript game inspired by the famous expression **'Poke the bear!'**.

## Implementation plan
Since this project is in development, below is a 'sketchy' vision of up-coming features as well as notes, logs, reminders, etc. 

### Todo
- Change the bear image conditionally when the rage-meter surpasses defined levels. 
- Add players list.
- Add a hint to show whose turn it is. 

### Keep in mind
- All images are temporary, improve quality and convert to proper format as the project grows.

### Rules
Players should take turns in poking the bear. As players keep poking the bear while the rage meter increases, someone will eventually be kicked out. The last standing player takes the price.
